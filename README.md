1. Check if a Number is Even or Odd
   
This program takes an integer input from the user and checks whether the number is even or odd. It uses an if-else statement to determine the result and displays it accordingly.

3. Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a Loop
   
This program calculates the sum of all integers from 1 to 50 using a for loop. It iterates through the numbers in this range and accumulates the total sum, which is then displayed.
